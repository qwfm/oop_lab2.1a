# Database Management System for Internet Shop
The DBSM is designed to manage the data of an internet shop, including suppliers and their products. The system allows for the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of supplier and product records. The DBMS is implemented in C++ and uses binary files for data storage, ensuring efficient and persistent data management.

The repository also contains a documentation, made in doxygen, and some separate glossaries of classes, methods, functions and operations.
